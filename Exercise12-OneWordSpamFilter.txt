Let's start with a message that only has one word in it: “million”.
Your task: Calculate the posterior odds for spam given this word using the table above, starting from prior odds 1:1. 
Keep in mind that the odds is not the same as the probability, which we would usually express as a percentage.
Give your answer in the form of a single decimal number x.x using the dot '.' as the decimal separator.
(Remember that odds can be represented as xx:yy or simply as a single decimal number, say z.z (where z.z = xx/yy). 
You may wish to revisit the discussion on this just before Exercise 9 in Section 3.1 (Odds and Probability).)
---> 5.1
As you may have noticed, the structure of this exercise is identical to that of the previous exercise about medical diagnosis. 
We have the class label spam or ham, and one piece of evidence that we can use to update our prior odds to obtain the posterior odds. 
We decided above that the prior odds are 1:1. 
The likelihood ratio is obtained by dividing the probability of the word 'million' in spam divided by the probability of the word 'million' in ham. 
This we already calculated above, and it can be found in the table of likelihood ratios: the value is 5.1. 
Now multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to get 1:1 × 5.1 = 5.1. 
This is the posterior odds. 
Again, the posterior odds means that for messages that include the word 'million', there are on the average 5.1 spam messages for every ham message. 
Or to use whole numbers, there are 51 spam messages for every 10 ham messages. 
The probability value is therefore 51 / (51+10) = 51/61, or approximately 83.6 %.

To handle the rest of the words in a message, we can use exactly the same procedure. 
The posterior odds after one word, which you calculated in the previous exercise, will become the prior odds for the next word, and so on.
