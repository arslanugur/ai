Each dot on the figure corresponds to one student. 
On the bottom of the figure we have the scale for how many hours the student studied for the exam, 
and the students who passed the exam are shown as dots at the top of the chart, 
and the ones who failed are shown at the bottom. 
We’ll use the scale on the left to indicate the predicted probability of passing, 
which we’ll get from the logistic regression model as we explain just below. 
Based on this figure, you can see roughly that students who spent longer studying had better chances of passing the course. 
Especially the extreme cases are intuitive: with less than an hour’s work, it is very hard to pass the course, 
but with a lot of work, most will be successful. 
But what about those that spend time studying somewhere inbetween the extremes? If you study for 6 hours, what are your chances of passing?

We can quantify the probability of passing using logistic regression. 
The curve in the figure can be interpreted as the probability of passing: 
for example, after studying for five hours, the probability of passing is a little over 20%. 
We will not go into the details on how to obtain the curve, but it will be similar to how we learn the weights in linear regression.

If you wanted to have an 80% chance of passing a university exam, based on the above figure, how many hours should you approximately study for?

Answer: 10-11 hours

The other answers give roughly a 30%, a 50%, and a 70% chance of passing respectively. 
To have an 80% chance of passing, you should study for around 10-11 hours.

Logistic regression is also used in a great variety of real-world AI applications such as predicting financial risks, in medical studies, and so on.
However, like linear regression, it is also constrained by the linearity property and we need many other methods in our toolbox. 
We will return to the linearity issue later when we discuss neural networks.
