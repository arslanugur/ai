Now use the naive Bayes method to calculate the posterior odds for spam given the message “million dollars adclick conferences”.
You should again start with the prior odds 1:1, and then multiply the odds repeatedly by the likelihood ratios for each of the four words. 
Notice that the likelihood ratios are tabulated above for your reference (these are the numbers 5.1, 0.8, and so on).
Your task: Express the result as posterior odds without any rounding of the result. 
You may take a look at the solution of the previous exercise for help.
---> 65.1168
We start in the same way as the previous exercise. 
Multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio 5.1 (for the word 'million') gives posterior odds 5.1. 
Next we'll simply keep multiplying the odds by the likelihood ratios for the rest of the message. 
The likelihood ratios can be found in the table above: 0.8 ('dollars'), 53.2 ('adclick'), and 0.3 ('conference'). 
The product of all these numbers equals 1:1 × 5.1 × 0.8 × 53.2 × 0.3 = 65.1168. 
This means that for messages that include all these four words, 
there are on the average about 65 spam messages for each ham message, or about 651 spam messages for every 10 ham messages. 
If we wanted to get the probability value (which was not asked), it is about 651 / (651+10) = 651 / 661 or approximately 98.5 %. 
This message would probably end up in your junk mail folder.
