In the previous exercise, we only had data from three countries. 
The full data set consists of data from 14 different countries, presented here in a graph:

Based on this data, would your prediction about the life expectancy of people with 15 years of education change? If so, why?

Which of the following options would best match your estimate of the life expectancy for people with 15 years of education? 
Choose the most specific option that you think is justified by fitting the straight line model to the above data.

Answer: Probably between 50 and 90 years

The first choice would clearly be an odd estimate since the data strongly suggest that
very few countries have life expectancy less than 50, and none of the data points with more than 12 years of education fall below 50. 
We can't be sure, of course, but life expectancy between 45 and 50 years would in this case be highly unexpected. 
The second choice is correct because it fits the general trend, and all data points with more than 12 years of education fall within this interval.
The interval 69 to 71 years in the third choice could well include the actual value, 
but based on the above data, it would be too bold to claim to know the outcome with such high accuracy. 
The interval 15 to 150 years of the fourth choice would almost certainly include the actual value, 
but we think that it would be a poor summary of what we can learn from the data for the reason that it is too vague.
